#A list is defined as an ordered collection of items, and it is one of the essential data structures when using Python to create a project. The term “ordered collections” means that each item in a list comes with an order that uniquely identifies them. The order of elements is an inherent characteristic that remains constant throughout the life of the list.
#Since everything in Python is considered an object, creating a list is essentially creating a Python object of a specific type. When creating a list, all the items in the list should be put in square brackets and separated by commas to let Python know that a list has been created

#List = {1,2,3,4,'A','B','C',5}
List = ["Ajit", "Kumar", "Jodhpur"] 
print(List)

List2 = [['A', 'B'], ['C']] 
print(List2) 


list = [1,2,3,4,5],[1,2,3,4,5],[1.2,3,4,'Ajit']
print(list)
