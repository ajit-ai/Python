# A tuple is a read-only data structure for storing collections that
# don't need to be changed. You create one using ( and ) characters.

# Create a tuple with ( and )
my_tuple = (1, 2, "hello", 3.14, False, "hello")

print(type(my_tuple))

# Access an item by index using [ and ]. Indexes start at 0
print(my_tuple[0])

print(my_tuple[3])

#print(my_tuple[10])  # IndexError.

# Access a container from right-to-left
print(my_tuple[-1])
print(my_tuple[-3])

# Count number of items in a tuple
my_tuple.count("hello")
my_tuple.count(3.14)
my_tuple.count("blahblah")

# Search and get the index of an item
my_tuple.index("hello")

my_tuple.index(3.14)
my_tuple.index(False)
#my_tuple.index("blah")  # ValueError.


# Trying to change the value of an item in a tuple causes an error.
#my_tuple[2] = "newvalue"  # TypeError.


# Warning: If creating a tuple with only 1 item, you need to use this special syntax with a comma.
my_tuple2 = (42, )
type(my_tuple2)  # is a 'tuple' type

# If you forget the comma, then Python doesn't create the tuple.
